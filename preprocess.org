* Why
  * increase signal to noise

   [[./img/afni_auto_corr.png]]
   [[./img/tsnr_vs_meanfd_fdthresh=10.jpeg]]

* Software
 * =afni_proc.py= (afni+freesurfer)
 * =fmriprep=     (minimal, fsl+ants+nipy+freesurfer)
 * =preprocessFunctional=
   * ROBEX
   * ANTs + f[ln]irt (fsl)
   * nipy.algorithms.registration.SpaceTimeRealign
   * wavelet

* Inputs
** scanner: sequences/protocols
   * anat - mprage/t1w
   * func - BOLD/t2w
   * func/sbref - single band reference (BOLD)
   * fmap - fieldmap
** file types
   * ways of storing 2-4d matrices 
   * dcm (=*.dcm=, =MR*=, =*.IMA=)
   * nifti (=*.nii.gz=)
   * others: img/hdr, HEAD/BRIK, mgz, gii/gii.gz

* Considerations
 * multiband? have reference?
 * distortion correction
 * voxel size (smoothing)
 * tolerance for manipulation (wavelet despiking? ica_aroma? bandpass?)
 * task vs rest (bandpass, motion censor)

* Example preprocessFunctional
  * simplest (10 mins for 10 trs)
preprocessFunctional -custom_slice_times sliceTimings.1D -tr 1.5 -4d func.nii.gz -mprage_bet mprage_bet.nii.gz -warpcoef mprage_warpcoef.nii.gz

* Steps
  [[term:bash -c "preprocessFunctional -help | less +1\\\)\ "]]
  [[term:./afni_petrest.bash]]
  
** _ - reorient
   * orient the matrix as LPI (how the computer sees the data)
      Right	Left
      Anterior 	Posterior
      Inferior 	Superior
   * also remove first n volumes if told to (older protocols, automatically discarded now)

** t - Slice timing correction
   * each full brain timepoint measure is actually a collection of slices imaged at slighly different times (2d epi) 
   * top, middle, and bottom are imaged at a different times!
   * we want to estimate the value of each voxel as if all parts of the brain were measured at the same time
   * ~-no_st~ to do no slide timing correction (3d epi @ 7T, correction in GLM)
   * ~-custom_slice_times~ (multiband)

  https://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/docs/SavoyfMRI2014/fmri.april2011.pdf#page=17

** m - Motion correction

  * people move, the RF coil does not.
    * the place in space we measure is not always the same place in the brain.
  * we align all time points together (to the first, middle, or average)
    * the measure of movement is stored: regression, censoring

 TODO: options 

*** tm - 4D slice motion
   * we can correct for motion in each slice for a better estimate
   * takes a lot longer

** k - Skull strip, brain extract (bet), scalp
   * we don't care about the skull. so don't spend time working on it, remove it instead
     * intensity normalization (rescaling)
     * spatial normalization (warping)

** d - despike 
   * what to do with obvious outliers? 3dDespike or wavelet_despike

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Removes 'spikes' from the 3D+time input dataset and writes
     a new dataset with the spike values replaced by something
     more pleasing to the eye.
     #+END_QUOTE
     
     ~-wavelet_despike~
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   data-driven, spatially-adaptive, wavelet-based method for identifying, modeling, and removing 
   non-stationary events in fMRI time series, caused by head movement, without the need for data scrubbing.
   ... We demonstrate robust removal of a range of different motion artifacts.
   #+END_QUOTE

** u -"unwarpping" Fieldmap/spin echo  inhomogeneity correction
   * use a measure of strech/compression due to non uniform magnetization to undo
   * requires collecting a sequence independent of BOLD epi 
   * see https://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/docs/SavoyfMRI2014/fmri.april2011.pdf#page=21

** w - warp (spatial normalization)
   * make our differently shaped (nonlinear) and positioned (linear) brains look the same
   * allow comparing across subject part 1
   * depends on ~preprocessMprage~
   * epi <-> t1 <-> MNI152 (+tlrc in afni -- but not actually Talairach)
     * 6th generation. Neuroimaging standard. lowres. spm/fsl/afni default to this
     * 2009c. better 1mm res. differs by up to 2mm. we use this
   
   TODO: image of separate brains moved into mni
   
** s - smoothing

*** why

   [[./img/smoothing_handbook.png]]
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Smoothing increases the signal-to-noise ratio for signals with larger spatial scales.
 Because most activations in fMRI studies extend across many voxels, the benefits of gain in signal for
 larger features may outweigh the costs of losing smaller features
 ...
 ensure the validity of Gaussian random field theory for
 statistical analysis, then an FWHM of twice the voxel dimensions is appropriate.
   #+END_QUOTE
*** preprocessFunctional
    * FWHM size given by ~-smoothing_kernel~. default is 5 (mm)
    * ~-smoother~ defaults to fsl's =susan=, can use =gaussian=

** n - normalizing intensity (scaling)
   * can use median or mean
   * allow comparing across subject part 2

** a - ICA-AROMA (fancy, slow)
   * Automatic Removal Of Motion Artifacts, matching similarity to pre-identified spatial and temporal independent components
   * Pruim 2015 demonstrated on task and rest
   
** f - filter (high pass, task)

   * only allow higher frequency signal. give high frequencies a pass.
   * remove scanner drifts, coil interference or slow vascular/metabolic oscillations ([[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Neuroimaging_Data_Processing/Temporal_Filtering][wikibooks]])
     TODO: how to set
** r - regression (resting state)

   * useful for resting state to remove nuisance signal
   * for task, the next step is likely a GLM which can include nuisance regresses in the same model
   * measure from white mater, csf, motion, and their derivatives
** b - bandpass filter (resting state)
   * throw out too low and too high (physio .3Hz, 1Hz)
   * rsfMRI, unlike task, shouldn't have quick changes 
   * e.g. ~-bandpass_filter 0.009 .08~

** A - auto correlation removal 
   * useful for within individual, not so much in group comparison
   * 3dREMLfit to remove autocorrelation using ARMA(1,1) mode

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Thresholded individual subject activation maps are potentially affected ...
   The biggest effect of serial (AKA temporal) correlation ... 
   is on the estimates of the variance of the individual subjects betas

* PreprocessFunctional hints
** audit/log
   * ~preprocessFunctional.log~ lists nearly every command run. could be executed as bash script
** hidden files
  * =.preproc_cmd= - all the arguments to preprocessFunctional for this run
    * useful 2 months later
    * can edit and rerun ~yes|preprocessFunctional~. 
      consider removing =.preprocessfunctional_complete=
  * =.*_complete= - created for every finished step
    * remove to rerun a step
